<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello,

My name is Alec Gustafson, I am a senior in Community and Regional Planning with a minor in GIS. I am on campus this semester and I have some experience with Python coding and plenty of GIS experience through classes here at ISU and internships with the DOT and ACPF a company that produces watershed mapping tools to help rural land use planning . I hope to learn a lot about geodesign and using GIS to portray data and maps in a way that is practical and useful to the general public.  </p>
